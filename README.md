# Development of a Real-Time Data Pipeline for User Profile Analysis

## Project description 
Using Kafka and PySpark, we need to efficiently transform, aggregate, and store user data generated by the randomuser.me API. We should save the transformed data into a Cassandra table, and for the aggregated or analyzed data, we should store it in a MongoDB collection.

## API
The RandomUser API is a public API that provides randomly generated user data. It allows developers to retrieve fictitious user information such as names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and profile images. The API is commonly used in software development for various purposes, including prototyping, testing, and generating sample data.

Here's an example of the JSON structure returned by the RandomUser API for a single user:
```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "gender": "female",
      "name": {
        "title": "Ms",
        "first": "Emily",
        "last": "Smith"
      },
      "email": "emily.smith@example.com",
      "username": "crazyswan123",
      "password": "9s8d7f6g",
      "dob": {
        "date": "1990-05-25",
        "age": 33
      },
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "postcode": "10001",
        "country": "United States"
      },
