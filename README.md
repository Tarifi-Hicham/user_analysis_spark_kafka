# Development of a Real-Time Data Pipeline for User Profile Analysis

## Project description 
Using Kafka and PySpark, we need to efficiently transform, aggregate, and store user data generated by the randomuser.me API. We should save the transformed data into a Cassandra table, and for the aggregated or analyzed data, we should store it in a MongoDB collection.
